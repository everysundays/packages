# Mobile-Optimized Theory Documentation
**Implementation Date:** December 2024  
**Breakpoint:** sm (375px viewport)  
**Status:** ✅ Active & Tested

## Mathematical Foundation

### Core Problem Solved
- **Requirement:** Usable mobile layouts on small screens (375px)
- **Requirement:** Allow 2-column layouts for small components
- **Requirement:** Stack larger components vertically

### Simple Two-Width Approach

```javascript
// Target: 375px viewport, 327px available space

// FORMULA:
// col-1: Allows exactly 2 columns per row with minimal padding
// col-2+: Stack vertically using full width

col-1 = 49.24% // 161px / 327px available space
col-2 = 100%   // Full width stacking
col-3 = 100%   // Full width stacking
col-4 = 100%   // Full width stacking
// ... and so on
```

## Key Features

1. **Two-Column Support:** col-1 is sized to allow exactly two columns side by side
2. **Vertical Stacking:** All larger columns stack vertically
3. **Mobile-First:** Prioritizes readability on small screens
4. **Implementation Simplicity:** Simple percentage-based approach

## Implementation Notes

The mobile approach is intentionally simple to prioritize usability on small screens:

```javascript
const RACK_COLUMNS = {
  sm: {
    1: '49.24%',    // Half-width on mobile - allows 2 col-1 side by side
    2: '100%',      // Stack vertically on small screens
    3: '100%',
    4: '100%',
    5: '100%',
    6: '100%',
    7: '100%',
    8: '100%',
    9: '100%',
    10: '100%',
    11: '100%',
    12: '100%',
  }
};
```

## Offset Calculation (Mobile-specific)

Unlike other breakpoints, mobile offsets are simplified:

```javascript
// Only offset-11 is meaningful for mobile layouts
// It centers a col-1 element on the screen
offset-11 = '25.38%' // Perfect centering: (327px - 161px) ÷ 2 ÷ 327px = 83px/327px

// All other offsets are 0% since columns are mostly full-width
offset-1 through offset-10 = '0%'
```

## Common Mobile Patterns

```
✅ 1 × col-1 = Half-width card (49.24%)
✅ 2 × col-1 = Two cards side-by-side (98.48% + gap)
✅ 1 × col-1 + offset-11 = Centered card (49.24% + 25.38% offset)
✅ 1 × col-2+ = Full-width content (100%)
```

## Relationship with Other Theories

- While other breakpoints use complex mathematical theories, the mobile breakpoint intentionally uses a simpler approach to prioritize usability
- The responsive system progressively enhances layouts as screens get larger:
  - **sm:** Simple 2-column or stacked layouts
  - **md:** Harmonic Theory for perfect proportions
  - **lg/xl:** 12-Column Grid for complex layouts
